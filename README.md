# Jame of Life

A colorful cellular automata, developed in Java for a programming course.

## Features

This fantastic Game of Life implements everything Conway's Game of life originally implemented, plus the high life variation and the possibility to use custom rules (eg. 1 and 5 neighbors: survive; 0 neighbors : born) and even randomly generated algorithms.
Furthermore, Jame of Life can fill the grid at random for you and can display fractionnal generations.
